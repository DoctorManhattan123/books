# Books

This is created when I go through some topic and try to explain this topic on my own. The main reason for that is, that you get a deeper understanding of a topic when you actually try to write it down or to explain it.

Bear in mind that things might be inaccurate, but I try to keep them correct and with lots of examples.

## I found a mistake.

If you found a mistake, just open and issue or straight up a pr and/or write me a pm. If you read this, you probably know me personally.

## I miss a topic

Once again, just write me. Maybe I did this topic already, but I didn't write it down. Bear in mind, I won't ever do `Java`. I will not support this language.
