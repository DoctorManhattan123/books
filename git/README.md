# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

There is a lot to learn about this but we'll keep it short.

Most of the big internet hosting services use git as their version control ([github.com](github.com), [bitbucket.org](bitbucket.org)).

# How does it work?



# Basic commands

## Init

This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. An initial branch without any commits will be created.

```sh
git init
```
